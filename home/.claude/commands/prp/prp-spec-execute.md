# Execute SPEC PRP

Implement a specification using an existing SPEC PRP.

## PRP File, Phase to execute: $ARGUMENTS

## Execution Process

1. **Understand Spec**
   - Current state analysis
   - Desired state goals
   - Task dependencies
   - Identify the PRP file as $PRP
   - Identify the Phase to tackle as $PHASE

2. **ULTRATHINK**
   - Think hard before you execute the plan. Create a comprehensive plan addressing all requirements.
   - Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps using your todos tools.
   - Use the TodoWrite tool to create and track your implementation plan.
   - Identify implementation patterns from existing code to follow.

3. **Execute Tasks for $PHASE**
   - Follow task order
   - Run validation after each
   - Fix failures before proceeding

4. **Verify Transformation**
   - Confirm desired state achieved
   - Run all validation gates
   - Test integration

Progress through each objective systematically.
